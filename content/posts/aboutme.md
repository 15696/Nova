Hi i am Nova, a 12th grade student from India. I love to code, watch anime and play games! I am programming since about 4 years and i mainly do my projects in Python. I am learning Rust at the
moment.  
I love to study lower level stuff including virtual machines and networks and hope to do 
something big around them in future!

Also, i am a huge fan of [Typemoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-Moon)'s works, 
you can find alot of references from it in my github profile too!
I am currently watching the [JoJo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure) 
series, specifically the
[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure:_Stardust_Crusaders) season/part.

I am not really in web dev. much so used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and 
[hugo-theme-serial-programmer](https://github.com/sharadcodes/hugo-theme-serial-programmer) to make 
this site and also i got a free
domain from github so used that. Hosting this site on cloudflare pages.
