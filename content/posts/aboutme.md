Hi! I am Nova, a 12th grade student from India. I love to code, watch anime and play games! I have been programming for about 4 years and I mainly do my projects in Python. I am learning Rust at the moment.  
I love to study lower level stuff including virtual machines and networks and hope to do 
something big around them in future!

Also, I am a huge fan of [Typemoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-Moon)'s works, 
you can find a lot of references to it in my github profile too!
I am currently watching the [JoJo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure) series
and reading the [Umineko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umineko_When_They_Cry) VN.

I am not really interested in web dev, so I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and 
[hugo-theme-serial-programmer](https://github.com/sharadcodes/hugo-theme-serial-programmer) to make 
this site. This site is hosted on CloudFlare Pages, and the domain is courtesy of GitHub's Education Pack.

Also i use arch btw.
